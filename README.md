In this article, Bhavya Kashyap talks about how code camps can potentially be a problem, because they only cover CS concepts on a fundamental level. For most people, CS is only about coding and so, in these code camps, people only learn how to code. However, in reality, software engineering is not only about coding, it expands a lot more and includes building strategies, applying concepts to solve problems, and much more. She goes on to talk about how code camps originated because of the high demand in CS jobs and it was a good way to bring the minority into the field. However, reality is that majority of the minority ends up working on a no fund company. Therefore, she believe that code camps can be good, but there should be more opportunity to learn beyond coding and the fundamentals.
